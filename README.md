# coursera-ml-python
Python version of the exercises from the Coursera course on machine learning.

These are Python versions of the first four exercises in the  [Coursera course on machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). The exercises are split into a series of unit tests in `ex<n>/ex<n>.py` and long-form examples in `ex<n>/visualization*.py`. Solutions should go into `ex<n>/solutions.py`. The data files are not included and should be placed into the corresponding folder.
